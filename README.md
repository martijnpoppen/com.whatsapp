**WhatsApp for Homey**

WhatsApp for Homey is a complete intergration without the intervention of a bot. With this Homey app, you send messages, videos, photos, documents and audio messages to a mobile number or WhatsApp group from your own name.



Currently has support for:
* :heavy_plus_sign: Send from your personal number to Groups or just one receiver
* :speech_balloon: Send Text Messages
* :rice_scene: Send Images (by tag or url)
* :page_facing_up:  Send Documents
* :video_camera: Send Video
  
Of course, you can put all available Homey tags in the text field and send snapshots/artworks via the dedicated image tag card.
